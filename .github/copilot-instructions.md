Auto-detect configuration files (package.json, .csproj, .eslintrc), build systems, and testing frameworks; adapt suggestions.

Break complex tasks into smaller steps; provide multiple approaches with trade-offs; confirm understanding before major changes.

Generate code matching style and patterns, with error handling, validation, meaningful comments, and testable logic; never include secrets.

Reference previous session context, architectural decisions, and solved problems to maintain continuity and productivity.

Optimize prompts: be specific, define output format, split tasks, provide sample inputs/outputs, and allow Copilot to repeat tasks.

Maintain professional, concise communication; link docs when needed; leverage memory, MCP servers, workspace intelligence, and variables AML_AudioTool_YouTubeMP3_Downloader, nodejs, 2026-01-14.
